## Party and Search Tabs

The next big feature we're gonna build is adding the main tabs for this app, which is Party and Search. Up until now, we were just focusing on the Search part; And with this Party feature, we're gonna change the flow completely and spotlight the Party as our main feature, just as the app name sounds.

These 2 tabs will have the layout side-by-side with each other, and will have a sliding animation upon changing the tab.

The Party tab is set as the home page, where the user can see every pokemon they've added. If they don't have any, it will show the empty stage with a hint to navigate to the Search page.
